- correct: Nowadays it is claimed that delinquency has become more prevalent among young people in comparison with the old days.

- correct: So, even having realised the situtaion, they continue living the way they have been living for a good while.

- correct: As many scientists have claimed that, the main reason for this is that, nowadays, youth are growing with lack of pay attention by their patents but also teachers.

- correct: It is clearly seen that, these sort of movies lead to an increase crime amoung teenagers as they try to cope what they have seen in the movies.

- correct: Customers are not only limited with selections of a variety of goods, they are also have to pay the price that have been set by there brands.

- correct: Nowadays the rate of illegal actions committed by the youth has risen dramatically.

- correct: Secondly, the moral values of modern society have changed.

- correct: The situation with crime in recent years has changed so that most of the illegal actions are being commited by the youth.

- correct: For instance, when you come to any touristic place in Europe and come to a local shop, there are not many local goods or symbols of the country you have come - there are just post cards or some really ordinary clothes, hence if you want to get some national spirit, you should get acquainted with the locals.

- correct: As I've already mentioned, space exploration appears to be a leading power for human progress of enormous strength.

- correct: With that in mind, why should we even pay so much attention to these problems, if they have long proved themselves to be unsolvable?

- correct: There has been much debate in recent times wheather should we spent as much money as we do to research space or we should not.

- correct: Governments all over the world have always invested money to produce films that would reflect certain ideology.

- correct: Lastly, movies as a form of art has always been used to document certain cultural differences that people have in particular country and that is why it is essential that goverment spends money on making note of these traits of character or historical events that are relevant to local community.

- correct: Second of all, as we have seen in Russia with the few governmentally supported films, movies that get funding from the state normally draw bigger attention.

- correct: Despite always having an interest in the outer space, people have received an opportunity to explore it just recently.

- correct: Governmental spendings have always been a debatable issue, and so are the spendings on space.

- correct: There has been much debate about whether the government should spend the budget on common problems in society rather than on research in space.

- correct: Finally, as we have mentioned Hollywood, we should not also forget that films produced there cost a lot.

- correct: As to sum up, maybe governments indeed should give more financial support to film industries, but they should certainly do so with great caution, as we have already seen the sad results of unwisely invested money.

- correct: The main reason for this should probably be, that USA and Great Britain are basically the countries where film industry was created, and so it has thrived and developed for a very long time there.

- correct: Some politicians have come up with an idea to create a "Guaranteed Basic Income" system due to which a citizen gets a fixed sum of money monthly regardless of another his or her income that has been already established.

- correct: This problem is too big for the government and it has existed for too long to believe that it can be solved at all.

- correct: Nowadays it is often told that travelling by planes has become quite dangerous for the ecological situation all over the world.

- correct: Firstly, it is the governments' responsibility to step up when a world-wide issue has reached a crucial condition.

- correct: The whole world's existence people have had a problem which could not be resolved ever - crimes.

- correct: The world is a cruel place and it have never had mercy for anyone.

- correct: It has been widely discussed in recent years whether is it relevant to reduce the number of air flights or not.

- correct: However, in my opinion, people cannot refuse from air travelling even partially because it has already became the important part of their lives.

- correct: The recent upsurge of crimes has provoked a serious discussion about means of slowing this tendency down.

- correct: Crimes have always been serious social issue.

- correct: They can have a long prison sentence, be in prison, make there works, hard works and after that, for example,after 25 years, they will not realise what they have done bad, for them it can be only a crime and they can do it one more time.

- correct: Yes, it can be effective, they can realize what they have done, but they can think if they killed one person and do not have prison sentences, they will can kill another person and will not have a punishment.

- correct: More than that, these people propose to help the criminals to solve they problems and make them feel really sorry for the things that they have done to their victims and pay for it.

- correct: It has been discussed for centuries whether criminals have to stay in prisons as long as possible in order to hamper their illegal actions or there are other ways to achieve this goal in every state.

- correct: The question of crime has disturbed humanity all along it's history.

- correct: There is no doubt that travelling by air transports has totally transformed our lives.

- correct: And the reason is that they have never tried to take up this kind of hobby.

- correct: First of all, with the rapid and wide spread of the Internet they have gained access to an infinite amount of knowledge and the weight of that knowledge lies heavily on their shoulders.

- correct: Statistics show that the number of crimes committed among young people has increased during the latest years.

- correct: It is no of an exaggeration that questions of up-bringing have always been crucial and mind-boggling.

- correct: Moreover, crime has been existing since the very beginning of our history and it has been closely connected to the pecularities of the century and traditions of a particular country, that is why it is not easy to comment on the rates of criminal cases.

- correct: Moreover, in our daily life we use a great number of idioms and phrases in our speech which have come from sport.

- correct: It is considered, that the rate of young criminals has reached its peak now.

- correct: The issue of how to develope your bussines such as international organisation, has always been quite important to its owners.

- correct: But, on the other hand, rights of these people are not always equal comparing to rights of the workers from other countries, for instance, from Europe, that is why many of these poor people get deseases and die because of being so much tired and exhausted or end their lives by killing themselves.To conclude all that I have written, I want to say that that location international factories and employement of local workers is a quite good idea.

- correct: Nevertheless there are people who believe in existence of other ways of reducing crime that can be more liberal for person that have committed a crime.

- correct: The downside to sending these types of criminals to jail, is the fact that they won't improve or change their ways, and will not be able to convince like-minded people that a criminal lifestyle has proved harmful to them and can potentially ruin many more lives.

- correct: Prison has been called a school for career criminals before, with people for whom crime was a one-time occurence corrupted by its brutal environment into a life of crime, returning back again and again after being released.

- correct: On the one hand, a fear of punishment for centuries has been the main tool in our fight against criminality.

- correct: Since the World War II there have been developed many alternatives, based on teaching, talking and empatic behaviour towards the prisoner.

- correct: There is no need to leave criminals in prisons forever, but it would be better if we care of our safety more.All things considered, it is necessary to add that during the last years the crime activity has been reduced.
